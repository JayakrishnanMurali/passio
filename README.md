# CLI-Based Password Manager: Passio

## Overview
The CLI-based Password Manager is a lightweight, secure, and open-source tool developed in Go (Golang). It is designed to provide a free, built-in replacement for proprietary password managers like 1Password, tailored for developers and power users who prefer a command-line interface. The tool emphasizes simplicity, security, and portability.

## Objectives
1. Offer a secure, reliable, and user-friendly password manager accessible via the command line.
2. Support essential password management features, ensuring competitive functionality with tools like 1Password.
3. Provide encryption and secure storage for sensitive credentials.
4. Deliver a free and open-source alternative to paid solutions.
5. Ensure the tool is platform-independent, portable, and easy to install.

## Key Features

### Core Features
1. **Password Storage**
   - Secure storage of passwords and other sensitive data.
   - Data is encrypted using AES-256 encryption.

2. **Password Retrieval**
   - Retrieve passwords via a simple and intuitive CLI command.
   - Optional clipboard copying for added convenience.

3. **Password Generation**
   - Generate strong, random passwords with customizable parameters (length, inclusion of special characters, etc.).

4. **Search Functionality**
   - Search for entries by name or tags.

5. **Tabular View**
   - Display stored credentials in a table format (with masked passwords).
   - Allow filtering and sorting by fields such as name, creation date, or tags.

6. **Secure Master Password**
   - A single master password to access the toolâ€™s features.
   - Master password is hashed and never stored in plain text.

7. **Data Import/Export**
   - Import data from popular password manager formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
   - Export data securely (encrypted by default).

8. **Audit and Analytics**
   - Check for weak or reused passwords.
   - Report on password age and recommend updates.

### Advanced Features (Post-MVP)
1. **Cloud Sync**
   - Optional integration with secure cloud storage providers (e.g., AWS S3, Google Drive) for backups.
   - End-to-end encryption for synced data.

2. **Multi-User Support**
   - Shared credentials and role-based access control.

3. **Integration**
   - APIs for integration with CI/CD pipelines or developer workflows.

4. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - Store and manage 2FA tokens.

## Technical Requirements
1. **Programming Language**: Go (Golang)
2. **Storage Backend**: SQLite for local storage with optional support for JSON/flat files.
3. **Encryption**: AES-256 for data encryption and PBKDF2 for secure key derivation.
4. **CLI Framework**: Cobra or a similar Golang CLI library.
5. **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies for portability and security.
6. **Cross-Platform Support**: Must work on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
